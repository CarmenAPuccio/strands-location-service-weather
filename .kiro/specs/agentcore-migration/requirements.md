# AgentCore Migration Requirements

## Introduction

This specification outlines the migration of the existing Strands-based location-weather service to support AWS Bedrock AgentCore deployment while maintaining backward compatibility with current local CLI and Q CLI MCP server functionality. The goal is to create a unified codebase that can operate in multiple deployment modes through configuration.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Multi-Mode Architecture Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the application to support multiple deployment modes (local, Q CLI MCP, and AgentCore) from a single codebase, so that I can choose the appropriate deployment strategy for different environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is configured for local mode THEN it SHALL use BedrockModel with locally defined tools
2. WHEN the application is configured for Q CLI mode THEN it SHALL expose MCP server functionality with FastMCP
3. WHEN the application is configured for AgentCore mode THEN it SHALL use AgentCoreModel with remotely defined action groups
4. WHEN switching between modes THEN the core business logic SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN in any mode THEN the LocationWeatherClient.chat() interface SHALL remain consistent

### Requirement 2: AgentCore Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to deploy the location-weather service using AWS Bedrock AgentCore, so that I can leverage managed infrastructure and enterprise features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to AgentCore THEN weather tools SHALL be implemented as Lambda functions
2. WHEN deploying to AgentCore THEN location services SHALL use native AWS Location Service integration
3. WHEN using AgentCore THEN the agent SHALL be configured with appropriate instructions and action groups
4. WHEN using AgentCore THEN OpenAPI schemas SHALL be defined for all tool interfaces
5. WHEN using AgentCore THEN IAM roles and policies SHALL be properly configured for service access

### Requirement 3: Tool Migration Strategy

**User Story:** As a developer, I want existing Python tools to be migrated to Lambda functions, so that they can be used by AgentCore while maintaining the same functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN migrating get_weather tool THEN it SHALL be packaged as a Lambda function with identical input/output
2. WHEN migrating get_alerts tool THEN it SHALL be packaged as a Lambda function with identical input/output
3. WHEN migrating tools THEN error handling and logging SHALL be preserved
4. WHEN migrating tools THEN HTTP session optimization SHALL be maintained in Lambda context
5. WHEN tools are deployed THEN they SHALL be accessible via AgentCore action groups

### Requirement 4: Configuration Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want configuration-driven deployment mode selection, so that I can easily switch between local, MCP, and AgentCore modes without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuration specifies deployment mode THEN the appropriate model type SHALL be instantiated
2. WHEN in local mode THEN tools SHALL be loaded from Python modules
3. WHEN in AgentCore mode THEN tools SHALL be accessed via action groups
4. WHEN configuration changes THEN no code modifications SHALL be required
5. WHEN invalid configuration is provided THEN clear error messages SHALL be displayed

### Requirement 5: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want existing functionality to continue working unchanged, so that current integrations and workflows are not disrupted.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using local CLI THEN all current features SHALL work identically
2. WHEN using Q CLI MCP server THEN all current features SHALL work identically
3. WHEN using existing configuration files THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
4. WHEN calling LocationWeatherClient.chat() THEN the interface SHALL remain unchanged
5. WHEN using any deployment mode THEN response quality and accuracy SHALL be maintained

### Requirement 6: Development and Testing Support

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test AgentCore integration locally, so that I can develop and debug without requiring AWS deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing locally THEN AgentCore mode SHALL be testable with mock services
2. WHEN running tests THEN all deployment modes SHALL be covered
3. WHEN debugging THEN appropriate logging SHALL be available for each mode
4. WHEN developing THEN hot-reload functionality SHALL work for local mode
5. WHEN testing THEN integration tests SHALL validate all deployment modes

### Requirement 7: Deployment Automation

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated deployment of AgentCore resources, so that I can reliably deploy and manage the service infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying to AgentCore THEN Lambda functions SHALL be automatically packaged and deployed
2. WHEN deploying to AgentCore THEN agent configuration SHALL be automatically applied
3. WHEN deploying to AgentCore THEN IAM roles and policies SHALL be automatically created
4. WHEN deploying to AgentCore THEN action groups SHALL be automatically configured
5. WHEN deployment completes THEN health checks SHALL verify service functionality

### Requirement 8: Protocol and Communication Strategy

**User Story:** As an architect, I want to define the communication protocols for each deployment mode, so that the system uses the most appropriate protocol for each environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN in local CLI mode THEN direct Python function calls SHALL be used for tool execution
2. WHEN in Q CLI MCP mode THEN MCP (Model Context Protocol) SHALL be used for tool communication
3. WHEN in AgentCore mode THEN HTTP/REST SHALL be used for Lambda function invocation via action groups
4. WHEN switching protocols THEN tool input/output schemas SHALL remain consistent
5. WHEN using any protocol THEN error handling and timeout behavior SHALL be standardized

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want comprehensive monitoring across all deployment modes, so that I can track performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN using any deployment mode THEN OpenTelemetry tracing SHALL be maintained
2. WHEN using AgentCore THEN AWS CloudWatch metrics SHALL be available
3. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be properly logged and traced
4. WHEN performance issues arise THEN metrics SHALL provide actionable insights
5. WHEN debugging THEN correlation between modes SHALL be possible through consistent trace IDs
